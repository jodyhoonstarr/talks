# Explorer

Not going away  

<v-clicks>

Continue to maintain and improve

Integrate margins

Revamp during research phase

</v-clicks>

layout: two-cols

# Good

Where explorer does well

<v-clicks>

- Simple and easy <span class="text-sm text-gray">(if you "get it")</span>

- Single institution <span class="text-sm text-gray">(obviously)</span>

- Desktop browser

- All data rows used

- Flows industry x geography

</v-clicks>


::right::

# Not Great

Where explorer doesn't/can't shine

<v-clicks>

- Limited comparisons

- Changes over time

- Mobile users

- All cells not used (e.g. grad counts)

- No context <span class="text-sm text-gray">(if you don't "get it")</span>

- One way in <span class="text-sm text-gray">(institution -> degree level -> cohort -> program)</span>

</v-clicks>

# Margins

We need margins to become the focus <span class="text-sm text-gray">(Cont'd from production planning discussion)</span>

<v-clicks>

- Note: assume `degree level` is the root margin <span class="text-sm text-gray">(for data and all following slides)</span>

- All Institutions (National)

- All Institutions (State) <span class="text-sm text-gray"><- in progress, examining composition effects</span>

- Wishlist: 6-digit CIP Earnings at State/National margin

- Wishlist: 2-digit/4-digit CIP Earnings by Industry/Geography at State/National margin

- Wishlist: Institution count contributing to Earnings at margins <span class="text-sm text-gray">(e.g. y1_inst_earn)</span>

</v-clicks>

# Why?

Why make big changes? Why is it useful? Why can't explorer do it?

<v-clicks>

- Margins are wildly useful

- With margins we can "walk" PSEO data <span class="text-sm text-gray">(program -> detailed program -> state -> institution)</span>

- Margins on incomplete data require context <span class="text-sm text-gray">(mitigate composition effect tradeoffs)</span>

- Context requires space

- Dashboard apps don't have space, longform apps do

- Show side-by-side <span class="text-sm text-gray">(earnings, counts over time, flows, context)</span>

- Crafted viz and explanation per view

</v-clicks>
